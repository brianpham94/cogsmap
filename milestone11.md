# Team K5’s Milestone 11

**Description of what each team member has done on the project**
Thomas Loh: I worked on pulling review data from Yelp API and turning it into useful functions for my teammates to use in an easy way. Worked on filtering search results by categories and allowing a user to customize their search options based on the categories given to them. Made it dynamic.

Lauren Gong: I worked on implementing the modals that open after users click on the “Reviews” button on the popups connected to each marker. The content of the modals are the text, rating, and time created of reviews grabbed from the Yelp API. 

Hyungyun Kim: I made buttons after users searching using keywords.User click buttons, and map automatically zoom-in and move that place right away. I also made two graphs after searching, so users can see which place is highest value in each category (ratings, reviews). I also redesigned UI of our app.

Brian Pham: I worked on correcting the search function and preventing it from displaying wrong data if user enters nothing in one of the search bar. I also looked into solving issues with the “Reviews” modals and how it can be displayed to users without issues.
