**Description**

Thomas Loh: worked on creating yelp search calls for the search bar function and allowing for given inputs to create circles on the map based on business popularity as well as reviews.

Lauren Gong: I worked on making sure the different circles can be filtered based on popularity. I also worked on making sure that the map will zoom into a specific circle when the user clicks on it and implemented location tracking so that the user's current location is shown.

Brian Pham: I looked into Google Maps API, specifically the Places Search Library to look to implement the maps search function for our search bar. I was successful in implementing the autocomplete part of the maps search bar and will continue to work on adding the interactive map search functionality.

Hyungyu Kim: First, I created layers of places depends on categories (Restaurant/other hot spots), so users can select menu on the left. I have added a panel which shows list of places of an area below the map, so users can see all the places belong the area. In terms of progress

**Screenshot Description**

Our map's core functionality. Map still works just like last time. We improved this one by adding more filtering categories on the left and impleneting the circles or regions to be clickable and provide more details when clicked.

When user clicks on a region, it magnifies and lists all the available activities within that hotspot

User can filter activities within that circle with bar on the left

User can now input their searches into the search bar and it will autocomplete/list available results based on search query, similar to google maps search bar.
