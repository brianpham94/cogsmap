#**1. A Project title**
FootTracker

#**2. A Summary**

Wonder what cool things people are doing near you? FootTracker can help you discover popular events & places based on foot traffic patterns.

#**3. Storyboard**

#**4. Description of feedback from first set of storyboards**

After receiving the variety of feedbacks from multiple teams throughout both class sessions, the consensus seems to be that most of our ideas were either really cool but not feasible, or too simple and had already been done before. One of the storyboards that stood out to the majority of the feedbacks was the foot-tracking idea. 

#**5. Description of proposed project's features**

The goal of this project is to provide a way for users to find popular places or events going on around them. This would ideally be tracked through check-ins that would allow people to see ‘hot-spots’ of activity near their area. 

The visualization of these hotspots would take the form of a map with different hotspots labeled with different colored pins. Ideally, colors will correspond with the level activity in the specified area with darker colors signifying ‘hotspots’ while lighter colors would be regions of little to no activity. Additionally, we propose having a visualization of different weather patterns throughout the area since we found that weather is something that is relatively important when people are choosing something to do. This could also be color coded as well to give a better indication of the differing temperatures in the areas near users.

We would also like to provide additional information once users select a certain area or hotspot to help them choose where to go. Once a region is selected, a pop-up or modal could appear, giving more information such as the categories of activities that could be done.

We were also considering allowing users the option to filter regions based on certain features (i.e. weather or activities to do) in order to lend flexibility in the ways they can interact with the interface.

#**6. Description of how you will split the programming work**
First, an idea and research has to be done for all member.
Second, we divide four roles to implement for skeleton/environment

(1) UI/UX Design - Assign two persons
(2) Data handler
(3) Map API management (Leaflet JS)

Since features above is not much related to “code work”, we divide each part and have responsibility in it.
We will discuss all deliverable milestone using Google document/Meeting on campus, and will divide up four code-tasks every meeting. Since all major coding expected be used “JavaScript”, it seems to easy to divide up each features. 

We will also using “Cloud9” which is cloud-based code web-editor when we all doing code for same file, so we can avoid complicated merging issue from Git version control.
