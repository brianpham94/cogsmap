***Lauren Gong's Prototype***

At the bottom of the side menu, there is an option for users to save their current search. It asks them to create a name, short description, and asks them categorize their search based on event or type of business. From the settings, they can access a page called “Saved Searches” where they can revisit the searches they’ve saved and take a look at the top places that were returned in that search.
