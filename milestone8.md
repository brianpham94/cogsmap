**Screenshot Description**

Our map's core functionality. Map still works just like last time. We improved this one by adding more filtering categories on the left and impleneting the circles or regions to be clickable and provide more details when clicked.

When user clicks on a region, it magnifies and lists all the available activities within that hotspot

User can filter activities within that circle with bar on the left

User can now input their searches into the search bar and it will autocomplete/list available results based on search query, similar to google maps search bar.
