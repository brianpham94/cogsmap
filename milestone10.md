# Team K5’s Milestone 10

**Elevator Pitch**


**What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.**  
We are trying to help people who are unfamiliar with an area to find something to do. The goal of our app is to provide people with a list of businesses and activities to explore based on a specified search or their current location. 

**How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**  
It’s done today through the uses of online trip planners, such as tripadvisor and tripit.  We believe that these current practices are limited because the user is required to have a goal in mind about the places they’re traveling to. These current practices don’t necessarily serve users who don’t have a clear goal in mind when they travel, as you can’t plan out a trip if you don’t know what you want to do on said trip. 

**What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**  
What we provide, is a way to visualize where locals and tourists typically congregate on a map for a user to see, and projecting all the results in an area of their choosing.  We target a large audience that is usually always at a  loss of what to do when they enter somewhere unfamiliar.


**Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?**  
All business people such as travel, local communities is really care about our app because our app strongly affects their business - even we affect their profits too. Since our app is using actual data user based, so it is objective standard visitors to choose places they might like. It is also useful to traveller to plan their schedule because a map is showing potential path when they travel.
