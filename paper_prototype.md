**Prototype #4 Brian Pham**
Description: The picture on the left is of the main screen that the user will see most often. There's a search bar and a hamburger menu. The regions are divided up into most-mid-least popular categorized from our data. There are also icons used to represent activities that are present in each region. The hamburger menu can be pressed and lead to the image on the top right. It includes the user's profile, reviews, setting and such. When pressed on a specific area, the screen zooms in and really highlights and describes each of the little icons from before. Another screen also pops out and lists the icon's rating, reviews, popularity and more!
