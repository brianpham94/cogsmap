**Description**

Thomas Loh: I've researched into the Yelp API and was able to confirm that we're able to retrieve the required data from Yelp. This allows us to track check-ins/reviews of specific locations later in the future and will serve as our data.

Lauren Gong: I basically worked on doing the initial set up of leaflet by using OpenStreetMap for the actual map and figured out how to position it over San Diego/place markers onto the map.

Hyungyun Kim: I put multiple layers so users can choose layer that they want to see on the map. (aka. filter on map) - Our app use this functionality to classify categories such as resturants, surfing or travelling. I made skeleton codes(including temporary layout of the app) with Bootstrap library in Node.js environment.

Brian Pham: I've researched into the diffrent map API's that Professor Guo presented us with in lecture and nominated Leaflet as our main map API. I've helped in designing/finalizing our "final" UI look that our team feels comfortable implementing.

**Screenshot Descriptions**

This is a screenshot of what we have so far for our app. We've implemented the basic core component of the map and we've also implemented the circles and markers that we plan to use later on. The circles will eventually serve as categorization tools for different areas of the map. The markers will eventually be replaced with different icon images of different hotspot activities in the area.
